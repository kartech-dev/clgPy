Write a program that asks the user for a word and searches for it in a text le, printing the line numbers where it appears. 5. Write a program that writes a list of numbers [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] to a le (one per line), then reads the le and prints the numbers as a list. 6. Write a program to count the number of lines in a le. 7. Write a program to search for the line numbers that contain a given word. 8. Create a program to count the number of words in a le. 9.

Write a program to divide two numbers given by the user. Handle the case when the denominator is 0 using try-except and display a friendly message. 11. Write a program to take two inputs from the user and perform division. Handle both ValueError (if user enters non-numeric input) and ZeroDivisionError. 12.
